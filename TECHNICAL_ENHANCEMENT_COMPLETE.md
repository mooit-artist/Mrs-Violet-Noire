- Performance metrics logging to `performance_metrics.log`
- Error tracking with timestamp and context

‚úÖ **Robust Error Handling**
- Try-catch blocks around all critical operations
- Graceful failure modes with user-friendly messages
- Automatic cleanup and metric saving

‚úÖ **Modular Class Architecture**
- `EnhancedMeetingOrchestrator` class for main logic
- `PerformanceMonitor` class for metrics tracking
- `ModelCache` class for intelligent caching
- `HealthChecker` class for system monitoring
