## Reporting a Vulnerability

The Mrs. Violet Noire project takes security seriously. If you discover a security vulnerability, please follow these steps:

### 1. **Do NOT** create a public GitHub issue

Security vulnerabilities should not be reported publicly until they have been addressed.

### 2. Email Security Report

Send an email to: **security@mrs-violet-noire.com** (or repository owner)

Include the following information:
- **Type of vulnerability** (e.g., XSS, SQL injection, authentication bypass)
- **Location** of the vulnerability (file path, URL, specific component)
- **Description** of the vulnerability and potential impact
- **Steps to reproduce** the vulnerability
- **Proof of concept** (if applicable)
- **Suggested fix** (if you have one)

### 3. Response Timeline

- **Initial Response**: Within 48 hours
- **Vulnerability Assessment**: Within 1 week
- **Fix Development**: Within 2 weeks (depending on severity)
- **Public Disclosure**: After fix is deployed

## Security Measures

### Automated Security Scanning

This project includes:

- **Dependency Vulnerability Scanning** (npm audit)
- **Static Code Analysis** (CodeQL, Semgrep)
- **Secret Detection** (TruffleHog)
- **Infrastructure Security** (Terraform Checkov)
- **Container Security** (Trivy)

### Security Best Practices

1. **Secrets Management**
   - No hardcoded secrets in source code
   - Environment variables for sensitive data
   - Secure credential storage in `config/secrets.env`

2. **Dependencies**
   - Regular dependency updates
   - Automated vulnerability scanning
   - Security-focused package selection

3. **Infrastructure**
   - Infrastructure as Code (Terraform)
   - Security group configurations
   - SSH key management
   - Encrypted data in transit and at rest

4. **Content Security**
   - Content Security Policy (CSP) headers
   - Input validation and sanitization
   - XSS protection measures

### Security Headers

The following security headers should be implemented:

```
Content-Security-Policy: default-src 'self'; script-src 'self' 'unsafe-inline' https://www.goodreads.com; style-src 'self' 'unsafe-inline' https://fonts.googleapis.com; font-src 'self' https://fonts.gstatic.com; img-src 'self' data: https://i.gr-assets.com https://s.gr-assets.com;
X-Frame-Options: DENY
X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff
Referrer-Policy: strict-origin-when-cross-origin
Permissions-Policy: geolocation=(), microphone=(), camera=()
```

## Vulnerability Categories

### High Priority
- Remote Code Execution (RCE)
- SQL Injection
- Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
- Authentication Bypass
- Privilege Escalation

### Medium Priority
- Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)
- Information Disclosure
- Insecure Direct Object References
- Security Misconfiguration

### Low Priority
- Missing Security Headers
- Information Leakage
- Insecure Cryptographic Storage

## Security Testing

### Local Security Scanning

Run the local security scanner:

```bash
./scripts/security-scan.sh
```

### Automated CI/CD Security

Security scans run automatically on:
- Every push to main branch
- Every pull request
- Daily scheduled scans
- Before deployments

## Security Updates

Security updates will be:
- **High Priority**: Patched within 24-48 hours
- **Medium Priority**: Patched within 1 week
- **Low Priority**: Patched in next regular release

## Responsible Disclosure

We follow responsible disclosure practices:

1. **Private Report**: Vulnerability reported privately
2. **Investigation**: We investigate and develop a fix
3. **Coordination**: We coordinate with the reporter on disclosure timeline
4. **Public Disclosure**: After fix is deployed, we may publish details
5. **Credit**: We provide appropriate credit to security researchers

## Security Contact

For security-related questions or concerns:

- **Email**: security@mrs-violet-noire.com
- **Response Time**: Within 48 hours
- **PGP Key**: Available upon request
